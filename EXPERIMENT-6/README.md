# Morphological operations

## Part-A Erode and Dilate
1. Erosion is a morphological operation that "erodes" the boundaries of foreground objects in a binary image. It works by moving a structuring element (a small binary matrix or kernel) over the input image and replacing the center pixel with the minimum value found in the kernel. If any part of the kernel overlaps with the foreground in the input image, the center pixel will become foreground (1); otherwise, it becomes background (0).

2. Dilation is the counterpart to erosion and is used to "dilate" the boundaries of foreground objects in a binary image. It replaces the center pixel of the kernel with the maximum value in the kernel. If any part of the kernel overlaps with the foreground in the input image, the center pixel will become foreground (1).

## Part-B Opening and closing
1. Opening is a combination of an erosion operation followed by a dilation operation. It is useful for removing small noise and fine details from binary images. Opening effectively removes small objects and gaps between objects while preserving the overall structure.

2. Closing is the opposite of opening. It is a combination of dilation followed by erosion. Closing is useful for closing small holes in objects and connecting objects that are close to each other.
