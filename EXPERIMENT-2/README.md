This code consists of functions for reading and writing BMP image files, as well as image scaling and rotation using nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation. The code reads BMP files, extracts metadata, and processes image data accordingly. It supports scaling and rotating images while applying interpolation methods. The scaled and rotated images are displayed using Matplotlib and saved as BMP files. This script enables image manipulation with interpolation techniques, providing a versatile tool for image processing tasks.
